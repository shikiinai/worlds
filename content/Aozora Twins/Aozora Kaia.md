## Employment / Education
Kaia is a traveler along with her twin little brother Kaito. Similar to [Kino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kino's_Journey), they have a rule where they can only stay in one place for seven days. The twins do odd jobs wherever they go to continue their travels. Kaia will take any and every job that she finds interesting. Bonus points if her heart is captured by the "unfortunate" client. People seem to flock to her, perhaps because of her bright demeanor... or because she looks gullible and easy to cheat.
## Criminal Record
Minor offenses, like forgetting to pay her tab or being too loud in public.
## Awards / Achievements
Kaia's personal record of staying awake is five days.
## Medical Record
<!-- Surgeries, Cavities, Illnesses -->
Kaia is nearsighted, but she wears contacts so most people don't know. She doesn't have glasses.

Kaia is an insomniac and does not sleep well. This goes hand in hand with [maladaptive daydreaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maladaptive_daydreaming), where her nightmares may continue to haunt her after she physically wakes up. Kaito can bring her out of it most days, but sometimes they break their rule and stay a couple more days to recover.
![[wakeup.png|Kaia waking up with tears in her eyes. The stress stitch loop on her neck is almost closed.]]
## Markings
<!-- Scars, Burns, Skin Damage, Birthmarks, Tattoos -->
A thin line with big and small stitch marks will start to appear on her neck as she gets more and more stressed. Eventually it loops around her neck, as if her head was sewn on.

## Other Distinctive Characteristics
<!-- Nose & Eye Shape, Posture, Body Shape, Legs, Moles -->
Her hair always parts to her left and does the Ghibli thing where it fluffs up or wilts depending on her mood.

She wears a single azure teardrop earring on her right ear (the side with the hair part). She never takes it off, even in sleep. Do not touch if you fear for your life.
# Personality
<!-- Cheerful / Gloomy? 
Humorous / Violent? Active? Sociable? Intellectual? Virtuous? Expressive? Weakness / Worries / Unusual Traits. What is distinctive about them? -->
Kaia is a ray of sunshine who wants to see all the sights the universe has to offer. She can and will climb all the mountains with Kaito in tow. Because of her childhood, she firmly believes that humanity is inherently good. She is very trusting and very susceptible to getting conned without Kaito.
## Formative Experiences
<!-- as an Infant / Young Child; include who was involved -->
Growing up, Kaia was locked inside a small room for a very long time. It was a lavish, luxurious room and she had all she could possibly wish for, except for two things: she could not leave, and she could not talk to Kaito. Their rooms were connected by a thick glass wall, so each could see the other. Kaia "talked" to Kaito by writing on the wall bit by bit, wiping their conversations away whenever people walked by. Eventually, they escaped together and have been travelling ever since.
## Dreams for the Future
To see all the world has to offer. Kaia has a lengthy bucket list of mountains to scale, lakes to jump in, and sunrises to see.
## Fears
Being separated from Kaito.
## Hobbies
<!-- Recreations, Clothing, Shelter, Habits, Favourite Phrases -->
Kaia is very excitable and has a lot of energy, so all of the activities she gets into involve some form of burning off energy. Exercise, hard labor, singing, dancing, etc.
## Special Skills
<!-- Fighting Styles / Sports / Dance / Martial Arts / Guns / Driving / Languages -->
Kaia specializes in midrange to long range combat, preferring poles and bows to incapacitate her opponents. If she used a gun it would likely be a pistol or a rifle. She learned basic Aikido for self defense, but she would rather run far, far away first.
## Strengths
Because Kaia is so trusting, people open up to her easily. She is a very good listener.

Kaia is very flexible and has very good core strength. She scares Kaito sometimes by balancing off a ledge or something.
## Weaknesses
Kaia is very empathetic, and can get lost in other people's stories.

Kaia can pass out suddenly if she is sleep deprived enough. She can also slip into her daydreams very easily and become unresponsive. As she likes to ignore her own wellbeing, Kaito has learned over the years to pick up on her tells and drag her to somewhere safe.

### Kaito
> [!quote] My baby brother! He's always so serious. He really needs to lighten up, smile more. Smiles make the world go round!

Kaia is older by 2 minutes and 6 seconds! The time is very important. She acts like a six year old and loses all of her braincells around Kaito, though. They take care of each other. Kaia couldn't have asked for a better brother.

## Problematic Relationships
