# History
## Humble Beginnings
I took a bit long to start one of Moe's commissions in late 2023. He finished the game he wanted the commission for before I even started discussing the proposal, so we pivoted and he asked for "mafia Moe" instead.

Well, I peaked. I actually believe I can't make a talking PNG better than this. Anyway, Bimu saw it, Bimu is weak to suits, Bimu also wanted a suit. Nothing much came out of it as everyone got busy, though.

## Sketch Pages
Early 2025, I drew a sketch page of Mafia Moe as a warm up and test for a new type of commission.

The three of us chatted about it in various streams and in DMs, and somehow Ren got involved (in death). Turns out Moe killed the wrong person, and Ren is back for revenge... and I was the one who told Moe to kill him. Oops.

Bimu mysteriously became the head of the mafia family Moe and I are a part of, and she commissioned a sketch page.

At some point, Timpani also joined in on the fun as the neutral party.

And here we are now. Welcome to the Mafia. Whose side will you take, Ren or Bimu's?
