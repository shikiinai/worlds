![[fen.png|Fen's color reference. Text is included in the character profile.]]

Sleepy boy and leader of the Keres. Harnesses miasma that seeps out of his body and burns others on contact. High density miasma can reach a solid consistency, but it also requires more energy. Fen talks very little, if only because he's so low energy all the time. He's willing to talk about poison and, in his words, "critical points" if you ask; no particular reason why he knows so much, it's his job.

The man needs sleep. Let him sleep.

## Employment / Education
As far as Fen is aware, he grew up in the Egg since he doesn't remember life before the Egg. [[Teach]] taught him everything he knows, and he would visit the main building of Morpheus for routine tests and check-ups. Aptitude tests and training assignments were completed on the Egg training grounds. He was summoned to Darian's office when he reached 16, and has been working as a Ker ever since.

Fen is not leader of the Keres by choice, rather the others tend to look at him for guidance. On paper he's listed as the leader because he's the first Ker.

## Criminal Record
Everything is sanctioned by Morpheus, so... none? :)

## Awards / Achievements
He has broken more devices than he would ever admit. The vitals bracelet he wears is one of the few devices that he hasn't broken (yet), probably because it's made of tungsten and is relatively unaffected by his miasma.
## Medical Record
<!-- Surgeries, Cavities, Illnesses -->
Fen is an insomniac. He can and will sleep anywhere, and the rest of the Keres tease him about it. He might actually sleep at the training grounds more at this point...
## Markings
<!-- Scars, Burns, Skin Damage, Birthmarks, Tattoos -->
When he consciously uses his power, a black triangle appears under both eyes. The more he uses it, the more triangles appear down his left side, trailing down his cheek and neck and eventually stopping at 8 on his shoulder. The last one is a big V-shaped arrow, throbbing with pain and eventually numbing his entire left arm if he continues to push.
## Other Distinctive Characteristics
<!-- Nose & Eye Shape, Posture, Body Shape, Legs, Moles -->
His hair is floofy and messy. He has eye bags.
# Personality
<!-- Cheerful / Gloomy? 
Humorous / Violent? Active? Sociable? Intellectual? Virtuous? Expressive? Weakness / Worries / Unusual Traits. What is distinctive about them? -->
Fen is reserved and a man of few words. He is loyal, though he already knows he's likely one of the "bad guys." He doesn't mind getting his hands dirtier as long as the Keres are alive and well; there is few that he hasn't done already, after all.
## Formative Experiences
<!-- as an Infant / Young Child; include who was involved -->
He doesn't remember :) You can't be hurt if you forget it, right? :)
## Dreams for the Future
A world where [[Agnes|Ari]] and [[Oliver|Oli]] live happily.
## Fears
Losing the people important to him
## Hobbies
<!-- Recreations, Clothing, Shelter, Habits, Favourite Phrases -->
Fen's hobbies include napping and training. He's always thinking up new menus for the rest of the group so they stay fit.

He prefers casual but form fitting clothes. He has a sleeveless zip-up that he wears on off days.

![[napClub.png|Fen and Ari in casual clothes, leaning against each other napping. The text reads Nap Club.]]
## Special Skills
<!-- Fighting Styles / Sports / Dance / Martial Arts / Guns / Driving / Languages -->
Fen fights with miasma. The amount of miasma he can produce is restricted by the blood in his body. However, he can also manipulate the miasma in blood he spilled previously. With concentration he can raise the density to a solid consistency, thus forming shields and blunt weapons. He has two signature moves -- for assassinations, he will cover the opponent's mouth with his hand and let the miasma burn their insides; against a group, he will send a wave of miasma, engulfing opponents and flattening them into nothingness.

Once his miasma touches organic material, it poisons the area with toxins and eventually leads to necrosis. In terms of appearance, this looks like severe burns. Because it's so hard to detect, Fen doesn't carry any weapons on him when he goes out, preferring hand to hand combat combined with his powers.
## Strengths
Fen is good at what he calls clean up. Rumors abound, but it's very difficult to pin anything on him (or Morpheus for that matter) as he covers his tracks well and the traces of black at the crime scenes cannot be traced back to him.

Fen drives a motorcycle on solo and pair assignments, and he can also drive the company van.
## Weaknesses
Despite Teach's best efforts, Fen doesn't have a moral compass. Rather, he knows some things are "wrong", but that doesn't stop him from doing them. Overall he's a "good" person, but loyalty to Morpheus and the Keres dictates everything else. Because of this, Darian will often order him to do things, but he doesn't feel like he is in a position to refuse. How he feels about said things is a completely different matter.

- He's bad at math, especially mental math.
# Social
## People They Admire
Passionate people.
## People They Dislike
People who don't respect personal space.
## Relationships
<!-- include behavior towards them -->
### Teach
Teach tried to raise Fen to be a good person. Unfortunately, she isn't a very good person either, but they both try their best with what they're given. Fen and Teach get along; they respect each other with lighthearted nagging. 

Teach does mini therapy sessions with Fen every couple days where they walk around the Egg, catching up on life and talking things out. Fen deflects sometimes by teasing Teach about her roommate.
### Ari
Fen jokes that no fun is allowed around Ari, but the fact that he jokes at all is an indication of how close they are. Ari nags Fen to take better care of himself, and Fen retorts that Ari should learn to protect herself.

They hang out together often, where Ari's nose is buried deep in a book while Fen catches a light snooze next to her. Sometimes Ari succumbs to the afternoon sleepiness and naps with him. 
### Oli
Most of Fen's brainpower on off days is dedicated to figuring out a routine that will burn Oli's energy. Fen welcomes the challenge, both mentally and physically, as he tests out the routine together with Oli to make sure there aren't any training gaps. Since Fen has much lower energy levels, Oli also pushes him to become more efficient when they train together.

Oli and Fen have a mutual pranking streak of 342. Mostly it begins with Oli and Fen retaliates with something equally silly, with short week-long pauses over the years by Ari's intervention ("Fen, be the bigger person!!" "Why???").
### [[Vino]]
Fen respects Vino for being very good at what they do. They were literally a blank slate when they moved into the Egg a couple years ago, so Fen is proud of them for growing so much. Fen can't claim to understand much of Vino's interests, but he's willing to listen when Vino needs a sounding board.

Fen hopes Vino never needs to go out on missions with him.
### [[Valeri]]
Fen does not like Valeri, full stop. They got off on the wrong foot, and Fen has his suspicions on other things, but she somehow gets under his skin every time she opens her mouth. It takes every inch of self control in Fen to stop himself from strangling her. He's still in disbelief that *this* is the mythical roommate that Teach won't shut up about, and is tolerating her purely for Teach's sake.
### [[Pinky]]
Put two introverts in a room and you have Fen and Pinky. They are amicable and respectful colleagues, but they don't talk or interact much beyond that. Pinky's near worshipping behavior of Darian unsettles Fen, but to each their own.
## Problematic Relationships
<!-- include behavior towards them -->
### Darian
> [!quote] Sigh.

Fen is loyal to Darian in that Darian is, monetarily anyway, contributing to the Keres' survival. He doesn't like Darian, and he certainly has thoughts about the missions he is sent on, but Fen learned early that questioning Darian's decisions would lead to worse things. Fen's modus operandi to processing his own actions is consciously forgetting or ignoring the things in his peripheral vision to release himself from the guilt. However, he still remembers in some shape or form, most often by the voices and faces that haunt him. 

All Fen can do is clear missions, ignore his blood stained hands, and pray that the rest of the Keres never have to do what he does.  
### Soren
Fen doesn't understand Soren. He grates on Fen's nerves, but unlike Valeri, he actually causes migraines for Fen. Fen is convinced Soren is his own personal hell, sent by whatever decided Fen had been complacent enough in Darian's schemes.

# Cafe Nowhere Fen
![[cafeNowhereFen.png|Cafe Nowhere Fen smiling faintly at a cup of coffee.]]

- Get you a man who looks at you the way Fen looks at coffee
- How much coffee? Yes.

Cafe Nowhere Fen likes spiced coffee, so much that he brought his own spices to the cafe. Valeri made him throw them out because his spices were two years expired, but she also bought spice tins specifically for him. They live under the counter so customers won't ask about it.

Although he's technically a junior majoring in Chemistry, Fen often skips class to practice coffee. His roommate is studying for the both of them... but the material comes easily to Fen, so Fen doesn't care much. The professors don't care much about inspiring their students either, so at this rate Fen might graduate with a B.S. in Chemistry and work at Cafe Nowhere full time.
