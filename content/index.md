Hello and welcome! This is where I keep notes, lore, project records and other things about my OCs (Original Characters). I have... many...

First, if you don't know who I am, I'm [[Shiki/index|Shiki]]. I'm also part of some groups that really like story telling, so you might see some projects and AUs (Alternate Universes) about that too.

If you're not sure how you got here, [press here to go back to the main site](https://shikiturret.xyz).
## Quick Rules
Some quick rules on playing in this space:
- Please do not take my OCs and call them your own. They are pieces of my soul.
- General character permissions:
	- Characters generally stay within their world. Kaito and Kaia are travelers, so they can interact with anyone and everyone!
	- **✓ Fan art**: there's an ongoing competition for the top 3 characters with the most art! I try to list them out every so often
	- **✓ Headcanons**: who knows, they might become canon
	- **✓ Ships**: be cringe and free, but don't be nasty about it. Don't yuck other people's yum.
	- **⚠ Fanfiction**: keep it SFW (no sex please. moderate gore / whump / horror is OK)
	- **☓ Kinning**
- Characters with different permissions will have them listed at the top of the page, e.g. [[Aozora Kaia]]
