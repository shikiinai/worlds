# Queensport
The Mafia AU draws inspiration from the Hong Kong Mafia and H.P. Lovecraft. The name of the city, Queensport, references both in the sense that:
- Hong Kong was governed by England for a while (and therefore under the Queen)
- Lovecraft has a recurring location named [Kingsport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lovecraft_Country#Kingsport)

# Characters
Shiki-owned characters in the Mafia AU.
- [[Mafia Shiki]]
- [[HAKU]]
# History
## Humble Beginnings
I took a bit long to start one of [[Friends#Moe|Moe]]'s commissions in late 2023. He finished the game he wanted the commission for before I even started discussing the proposal, so we pivoted and he asked for "mafia Moe" instead.

Well, I peaked. I firmly believe I can't make a talking PNG better than this. Anyway, [[Friends#Bimu|Bimu]] saw it, Bimu is weak to suits, Bimu also wanted a suit. Nothing much came out of it as everyone got busy, though.

## Sketch Pages
Early 2025, I drew a sketch page of Mafia Moe as a warm up and test for a new type of commission.

The three of us chatted about it in various streams and in DMs, and somehow [[Friends#Ren|Ren]] got involved (in death). Turns out Moe killed the wrong person, and Ren is back for revenge... and I was the one who told Moe to kill him. Oops.

Bimu mysteriously became the head of the mafia family Moe and I are a part of, and she commissioned a sketch page.

At some point, [[Friends#Timpani|Timpani]] also joined in on the fun as the [neutral party](https://wiki.timpaniumbra.xyz/AU-Showcase---Mafia/OC-Showcase---Mafia-Timpani).

And here we are now. Welcome to Queensport, where mafia meets the eldritch. Whose side will you take, Ren or Bimu's?
