# shiki_turret
## 3.0
![[030.jpg|Shiki_Turret 3.0 reference sheet]]
```
[2024.10.20] less supplies means metal arms, open water cooling and a jacket to protect from the elements
```

3.0 features a more complicated, "VTuber-ified" design. The jacket is longer with some more decorations. The crop top includes a ribbed design and zippers, with coolant cables out in the open. There is a single colored diamond between the shoulder blades on the back. The single earphone design has been updated to be sleeker and align with the overall color palette.

The hair pattern has been updated to look more natural without shading. The front and side tips are still darkened, but the back has been changed to a low light (as opposed to highlight). The glitch on the face is slightly smaller.

Shiki gave up on fixing their arms and putting on flesh paint, so their arms from the elbow and under is water proof metal now. Lines like veins light up and power the arms. The hands look like doll fingers, with the inner joints being the same color as the power lines.

Headset, eyes, glitches, coolant cables, the ribs and diamond on the crop top, and the power lines on the arms all change color according to energy levels. The order starting from full power is purple → blue → (yellow → ) red → black (OFF).

## 2.0

```
[2022.05.16] an offline accident resulted in more exposed circuitry and a replaced hand
summer outfit inspired by the outfit joei put together.
winter outfit inspired by sandalphon's primarch afterhours outfit
```

Shiki is darker, again. With each update they get darker and darker, farther and farther away from egg color. I started drawing a lot more, so I had the drawing glove on more often than not. I actually slept with it still on a couple times. My hand did not actually fall off that summer (thank goodness), but I did start having more problems with it. Building in the glove kind of served as a commitment to myself to keep drawing and a reminder to take better care of my body.

Around this time, I think I figured out how to put custom units on my page in Granblue Fantasy? So obviously I put [Sandalphon's winter skin](https://gbf.wiki/Sandalphon#Preview-2). I don't have a problem, what makes you think I have a problem?

The earphones were a spur of the moment decision when I was requesting a commission for Pokemon art with [[Friends#Ren|Ren]]. The massive upside down logo on the headset felt obnoxious, so I moved it to my shirt.

## 1.5
![[015.jpg|Shiki_Turret 1.5 reference sheet. Minor updates to the outfit.]]
```
[2021.05.27] an idol trainee, a mochi singer, and a robot became fast friends, calling themselves l'amour
```

It got really hot, and I also discovered my love for crop tops. I had this exact outfit with a few color changes. The headset had been bugging me because it didn't look quite right, so I modeled it off of my actual headset at the time.

The beginning of the dark hair tips! The front / back double tone hair quickly fell out of favor for me, but I still wanted two colors. Also made Shiki a *teensy* bit darker.

## 1.0
![[010.jpg|Shiki_Turret 1.0 reference sheet.]]
```
[2021.01.04] prototype of service robot inspired by portal turret  
[2021.02.18] official release of the directionally challenged robot with no memory along with origin blurb
```

The hair was from a Picrew that I had been looking at. I really liked the design, so I added more things to it until I had a full character.

The headset is reminiscent of Portal turrets.
