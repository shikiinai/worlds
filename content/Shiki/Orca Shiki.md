An alternate form of my online persona, if you will. Mainly used for
- vlogging / IRL pictures
- writing

Orca Shiki was originally going to be the "next step" for [[shiki_turret]] in lore. Unfortunately I like both designs, so they're both staying. Orca Shiki might pop up on stream from time to time when the color palette makes more sense, for example the Signalis series with SK-TR and OR-KA models.

## Inspirations
I did a color palette switch with [[Friends#bomi|Bomi]] in 2022 or 2023, and he drew Shiki with the hair color flipped. It basically looked like day mode Shiki (versus default night mode Shiki), but I really liked it so I workshopped.

Also I like orcas. They're menaces of the sea but they're so pretty. Monochrome my beloved.

## [[References#Orca Shiki|References]]
I still want to make a few small changes, but the general idea is there!
