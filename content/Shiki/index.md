## Whomst'd've'ly'yaint'nt'ed'ies's'y'es
Okay okay let me back up a bit. I do a little bit of everything, but mostly I like drawing and telling stories. I also play games, too many games. I'm most ~~consistently~~ active on Twitch and bsky... actually I'm not sure why you're asking, because if you're here you must have come from one of those places or even the website...
## Inspiration
The name "shiki" comes from 2 things.

**Shikigami** (式神) from Japanese folklore ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shikigami)). They're usually invisible, but you can see them if you bind them to paper dolls like the paper birds in Spirited Away. It's a nod to the many forms that I have had and will no doubt make more of in the future.

*shiki* is also the reading for 四季, or four seasons. Through time passing and seasons coming and going, I'm still me and I'm still here.
