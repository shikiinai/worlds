## Inspirations
[[Shiki/index|You already know about shiki.]]

The underscore is pretty important. It's my middle name. I forget it a lot, especially when websites don't allow underscores in handles. Oops.

Turret is a direct reference to the [Portal turrets](https://theportalwiki.com/wiki/Turrets). I'd always really liked them, and I like to think I'm pretty good at imitating their lines. When I was designing a stream avatar, I thought it'd be funny if I had their antennae on my headphones.
