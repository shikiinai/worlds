An alternate form of my online persona, if you will. Mainly used for

- writing

Orca Shiki was originally going to be the "next step" for [[shiki_turret]] in lore. Unfortunately I like both designs, so they're both staying. Orca Shiki might pop up on stream from time to time when the color palette makes more sense.

## Inspirations
I did a color palette switch with Bomi in 2022 or 2023, and he drew Shiki with the hair color flipped. It basically looked like day mode Shiki (versus default night mode Shiki), but I really liked it so I workshopped.

Also I like orcas. They're menaces of the sea but they're so pretty. Monochrome my beloved.
