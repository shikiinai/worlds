## Employment / Education
Kaito is a traveler along with his twin sister Kaia. Similar to [Kino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kino's_Journey), they have a rule where they can only stay in one place for seven days. The twins do odd jobs wherever they go to continue their travels. Kaito actually takes care of the negotiation and contract with clients to make sure Kaia doesn't offer herself for free. His ice cold demeanor and caustic remarks don't help, though, and sometimes he drives clients away because of his low tolerance for bullshit. When Kaia confronted him about it, he simply shrugged and said, "we aren't babysitters."

Kaito was trained to be a bodyguard for the family, including Kaia if she were ever to leave her enclosure. After Kaia proved unwilling to learn softer skills, he also took up the mantle of learning how to negotiate and manipulate others for the desired effect. He detests that skill and almost never uses it.
## Criminal Record
Technically, accomplice? Kaito is the one who picks Kaia up from the holding cells.
## Awards / Achievements
Kaito is proficient in any weapon under the sun.
## Medical Record
<!-- Surgeries, Cavities, Illnesses -->
Kaito has ARFID ([avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avoidant/restrictive_food_intake_disorder)). Kaia figured out most of his sensory issues, so he can tolerate most things Kaia puts in front of him now, but there are days where nothing can get past his tongue. It can be triggered without preamble as well, and Kaito views it as a nuisance. Kaia makes a strange concoction for him on those days, and they break their rule to stay a couple more days to recover.

Kaito also has a minor case of OCD ([obsessive-compulsive disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsessive%E2%80%93compulsive_disorder)) where he has specific rituals to complete whenever they enter a new area and acquire lodging. Kaia usually takes this time to scope out the area and get some bearings while he is occupied.
## Markings
<!-- Scars, Burns, Skin Damage, Birthmarks, Tattoos -->
Thin diamonds akin to gouge marks will begin to appear on his neck as he gets more and more stressed. They line up to form a ring in a similar fashion to Kaia's marks, but without the thin line.
## Other Distinctive Characteristics
<!-- Nose & Eye Shape, Posture, Body Shape, Legs, Moles -->
His hair always parts to his right and is impossibly straight. Coupled with his resting bitch face, it's almost impossible to tell how he's feeling. Smiles are reserved for Kaia exclusively.

He wears a single azure teardrop earring on his left ear (the side with the hair part). He never takes it off, even in sleep. Do not touch if you fear for your life.
# Personality
<!-- Cheerful / Gloomy? 
Humorous / Violent? Active? Sociable? Intellectual? Virtuous? Expressive? Weakness / Worries / Unusual Traits. What is distinctive about them? -->
Kaito is cold, caustic, and guarded. Despite his sharp tongue, he is kind to those who deserve it. He follows Kaia around like her shadow while she goes on adventures. The journey is the destination and he is determined to make sure they are both alive to see the end.
## Formative Experiences
<!-- as an Infant / Young Child; include who was involved -->
Kaito never thought much of his twin until the day he showed her a picture of the mountains outside. Watching her empty eyes light up like a sunrise in its own right made his own well up in tears. He wrote on the wall that they would leave soon. Together.
## Dreams for the Future
For Kaia's dreams to come true.
## Fears
Kaia dying.
## Hobbies
<!-- Recreations, Clothing, Shelter, Habits, Favourite Phrases -->
Kaito is a bookworm. He could spend hours, weeks even, in a library if not for their rule. He makes do by reading at least one book from each town they visit.

Kaito collects mementos of people they've met over the years in a well-worn travel notebook. Funnily enough, the travel notebook never seems to run out of pages...

Kaito exercises with Kaia and spars with her from time to time. It keeps both of them sharp. On bad days when they're holed up in their lodging and Kaia is struggling to leave her dreams, Kaito hums to her. He would sooner die than sing in public, though.
## Special Skills
<!-- Fighting Styles / Sports / Dance / Martial Arts / Guns / Driving / Languages -->
Kaito prefers melee combat, specifically Karate with two daggers. Before they left to travel, he also had custom boots that had knives embedded in the soles so his kicks would cut as well. If he used a gun it would likely be a hand cannon or a shotgun. He tends to grapple opponents so Kaia can create distance.
## Strengths
Kaito is very good at rooting out liars, and he doesn't take kindly to them.

## Weaknesses
Kaito is surprisingly weak to kids. Maybe it's because they don't know any better, maybe it's because of their brutal honesty. Either way, children really like him once they get over  his "scary face."

- Kaito is scared of bugs, but only Kaia knows.
- The best stories he tells are bedtime stories while everyone is curled up in blankets by a fireplace
- It is very difficult to pull him out of fury once he falls into it. All you can do is pray it's not pointed at you.

## Family Relationships
<!-- include behavior towards them -->
> [!quote] She needs help. She walks into walls at least twice a day and she gets distracted by everything. Really makes you wonder which one of us is the older twin.

Kaito is very protective of Kaia. He'll mess up her hair just to annoy her, and she frustrates him to no end with some of the things she does, but he can and will kill you if you hurt her. She reminds Kaito to slow down and smell the flowers.
