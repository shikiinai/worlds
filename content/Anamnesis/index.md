Main OC project centering on Fen and the people around him in the city Ataraxia. Nicknamed "Nemo" because Shiki stuttered on Anamnesis and said "anemone" instead, then shortened it to "nemo".

# Characters
Currently there are two main groups of characters, the Keres and people under Morpheus.
## Keres
The Keres project refers to a group of people living in the Egg, a suspended ovular building where Darian is researching self-sufficient ecosystems. Each Ker is given a codename (or project name, depending on who you ask), which is used mostly when talking about them in public as the Keres project considered level 2 clearance information. With higher clearance that basically consists of Darian, Pinky, Teach, and a couple more researchers, the experiment expands in scope to include observation of each Ker and their potential superpowers.

| Ker     | Codename | Notes                                                                             |
| ------- | -------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [[Fen]] | Erebus   | Leader of the Keres (by seniority), Darian's favorite                             |
| Agnes   | Hemera   |                                                                                   |
| Oliver  | Aether   |                                                                                   |
| Vino    | Hermes   | Does not have superpowers, but has impeccable memory.                             |
| Teach   | \-       | Technically not a Ker, rather their counselor and handler. Lives outside the Egg. |
| Valeri  | Raven    | Lives outside the Egg.                                                            |

## Morpheus
Morpheus built a city around itself by selling technology that allegedly makes all dreams come true, while keeping everyone safe, even from themselves. The CEO and founder of Morpheus, the Madame, split the company into two major departments: the Dreamers (research and development) who build creations to enrich lives, and the Knights (security) who protect them. 

| Employee | Title                                       | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Darian   | Chief Dreamer<br>Morpheus Research Director | He rose through the ranks quickly, obtaining the title of research director when he was 16. Naysayers were quickly silenced, whether by his achievements or other means.                                                |
| Antinea  | Knight Commander<br>Chief Security Officer  | Her impeccable business sense and way with people led her to obtain her title one year before Darian became research director. Though only 18 at the time, she nevertheless commanded respect from everyone around her. |
| Scarlet  | Secondary Knight  Commander                 | Antinea's bodyguard.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Soren    | \-                                          | A Knight directly reporting to Scarlet.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
## Other
Ataraxia houses many people, not all of them loyal to Morpheus. Not much is known about these people at present.
