My oldest OCs ever and closest to my heart. Kaia has gone through a million redesigns but she is thriving now (I hope). Unfortunately they are both my comfort and vent OCs, they receive equal parts of pain and happiness from me.

# Characters
## [[Aozora Kaia]]
As a pure ball of sunshine, Kaia's job is to drag Kaito everywhere and see *all* the things!
### History
Kaia is one of my oldest OCs. Given a couple more years, she would probably be legal to drink most places... which means she has aged up with me and gone through a myriad of redesigns over the years. Her happy disposition generally hasn't changed, except for a phase when I was fleshing out her current background.

She was originally a sona for me, but eventually both she and I grew separate from each other. I'm happy that she is thriving now, even if I give her pain sometimes.

Kaia is actually younger than Kaito by 2 years and 6 months (huh, where have you seen those numbers before wink wink), but I thought it would be funny for her to be the older twin.
## [[Aozora Kaito]]
Kaito lets himself be pulled into Kaia's adventures, content to witness the world in her eyes. ~~This is literally his vacation arc.~~
## History
Kaito is my oldest OC ~~that I can remember~~. He is legal and he can drink in all countries as far as I'm aware. His general design hasn't changed aside from aging up with me through the years. There was a phase where I tried to make him happier (and made him dance to Pon Pon Pon ðŸ’€) but that's not for him I think. He wiped that era from memory.

Kaito was originally an OC that I created for a universe with a friend. I was a lot more invested in the universe, making a bunch of other side characters for it, and we had fun playing in that space. Unfortunately,  I didn't part amicably with that friend, so I ended up killing everyone except Kaito. He was named something different back then (lol).

Kaito was basically a self insert, and I felt bad that his world had died, so I kept him around as a reaper of some kind, witnessing other peoples' lives. At some point he became a record keeper, living in an endless library that held all of my stories and dreams. 

Kaito finally got his own story and background when I started drawing him and Kaia together. Some time later they became twins, and after fleshing out their story he is now happily (?) stressing over keeping Kaia alive.
