![[00.jpg|Shiki_turret looks up blankly at the floating, snickering demon Sore from their seat in the middle of a trash pile.]]

Sitting on top of the trash pile, the robot wondered when the factory manager would return. The manager had told them to stay put, and mumbled something about a "darned glitch" as he left. It had been days, weeks, since then.

"You were thrown out. You know why? It's because humans are fickle creatures."

"I do not understand."

"You don't understand why you were thrown out?"

"If I obtain these emotions that I am told humans have, will I understand?"

"Maybe. I can give you that which you most desire. I’ll get something in exchange but we’ll work out the details later."

"Please do."

"Oh, hello! Nice to meet you, I'm Shiki!"

"I know, we've met."

"We have? I'm sorry, I think there might be something wrong with my memory."

"Don't worry about it. Enjoy your emotions."

"Thank you! I'm not sure where I am but I'll figure it out! What's your name, by the way?"

"You can call me Sore."

"Nice to meet you, Sore!"

![[01.jpg|Mai, Shiki and Ren fall to land on a chimney in the snowing night. The text reads, "Happy Holidays from L'amour."]]

"Wow, there are so many gifts in this bag!"

"It's cold, so make sure your parka stays on [[Friends#Mai|Mai]]."

"Got it, Shiki! It's pinned to my dress so no worries!"

"Hey, Mai, let's go to that house right under us. I got the rope ready!"

"Okay, [[Friends#Ren|Ren]]!"

"Wait, how are we- Ren!? Why'd you just jump off-"

"Mai is Jumpmaster!"

"Mai is WHAT- WAIT WAIT WAIT I HAVE A FEAR OF HEIGHTS-"

"WHEEEEEEEEEEE!"

"Ren! Congratulations!"

"Shiki! You look so good with that collared shirt, thank you for coming to celebrate with me!"

"The pleasure is mine! But uh... is it always this hot where you live, Ren?"

"Yep! Take care to hydrate properly, okay?"

"...Shiki?"

![[02.jpg|Shiki laughs sheepishly. Their shirt is soaked and their right hand is missing.]]

"I'm so sorry Shiki, I should have made sure we were inside longer..."

"It's not your fault, I didn't keep up with regular maintenance."

"But your hand, it's melted!"

"I can probably make something when I get back to the laboratory. I'll need a new outfit before we go out again, though. The circuitry up here is showing even more and I'm not sure I'll survive if I go out with this shirt again..."

"Oh, let's ask [Latte](https://twitter.com/latte_w_cream)! I'm sure [Joei](https://twitter.com/joeiwanko) will be willing to help!"
