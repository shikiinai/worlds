# Basic Information
> [!warning] Only Bimu and the Hime family doctors know Shiki's half slug heritage.
> Moe *might* know but he certainly doesn't show it. Others may feel that something is slightly off about Shiki.

## Employment
Shiki joined the Hime Mafia after becoming friends with Bimu. The contract stated that Shiki gets unlimited chicken nuggets and a safe haven for themselves. Despite their best efforts to conceal their slug characteristics, Shiki was heavily injured during the fight to break their previous contract. Even though Bimu saw their blue blood, she surprised them with kindness and acceptance, so Shiki vowed to follow her even should their contract end.

Shiki is the in-house informant and main operator for Hime Mafia. Their day-to-day responsibilities include gathering intel on other families and the situation at large; sourcing supplies for their squad partner Moe; beating Moe's time trial record on Cthulhu Kart; and navigating for Moe on days with missions. 
## Criminal Record
Minor offenses of hacking into government and organization servers; nothing was lost or stolen (that was reported), so they were let off with small fines.
## Awards / Achievements

## Medical Record
<!-- Surgeries, Cavities, Illnesses -->
Record of critical operation shortly before joining the Hime Mafia
- Doctor’s notes mention having a slimy substance playing a key role in the operation
- The body accepts blood transfusions normally, but integrated blood turns blue

Chronic pain
- Prescribed painkillers sit on their bed table
- Compression gloves
## Markings
<!-- Scars, Burns, Skin Damage, Birthmarks, Tattoos -->
Two hairline scars, one across the left eye and one starting right under the left eye, tracing down their neck into their clothes.
## Other Distinctive Characteristics
<!-- Nose & Eye Shape, Posture, Body Shape, Legs, Moles -->
- Twig body shape
- Hair listens to no one and goes wherever it wants
- Ahoge
- Has ashen, bluish skin like a dead person
	- They present as human, but they bleed blue, their tongue is blue, and their blush is blue. When they go out, they put on makeup and dye so their skin color and tongue color is more human-like.
# Personality
<!-- Cheerful / Gloomy? 
Humorous / Violent? Active? Sociable? Intellectual? Virtuous? Expressive? Weakness / Worries / Unusual Traits. What is distinctive about them? -->
Shiki will adopt a customer service personality if you have something they want. They act confident and aggressive, halfway to f\*boy (lol). They don’t necessarily *flirt* (unless that’s the most efficient way), but they do try to get in your good books so you’re more willing to spill the beans. Otherwise, they are blunt and sarcastic.

Everything in their room needs to be in a certain place. Move anything and they might make life harder for you wherever you need digital access over the next couple days.

They get shaken easily because of their sound sensitivity; they freeze and curl into a ball when scared and become impossible to move. Sometimes they may kick out after curling in retaliation.

Despite being the operator, they're very bad at directions and get lost without a map.
## Formative Experiences
<!-- as an Infant / Young Child; include who was involved -->
It's hard being half slug (descendant of [Gla’aki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Great_Old_Ones)). Shiki is very sensitive to climate changes and sound, so they were tagged as a problem child and left in the alleys of Queensport to fend for themselves. They did odd jobs for survival and became known for their hacking skills. After getting one of their bank accounts hacked and emptied, a mafia family took the child in, only to shackle them with a contract upon learning their heritage. Eager to please, Shiki gave in to their demands as they took more and more.
## Dreams for the Future
This one has no more dreams (a nod to Gla’aki's epithet, the Lord of Dead Dreams). If they had to pick one, it would be survival or to realize Bimu's dreams.
## Fears
There are many, but Shiki tries to keep it under control. They really can’t stand bugs. They almost burned down the Hime manor when they found a spider in their room once.
## Hobbies
<!-- Recreations, Clothing, Shelter, Habits, Favourite Phrases -->
Shiki enjoys exercising and staying fit. They also like making things with their hands. There is a well worn pile of clay on their desk and some small bits and bobs around the manor that they asked Bimu to fire. They gave Moe and Bimu each a small figure as a gift.
## Special Skills
<!-- Fighting Styles / Sports / Dance / Martial Arts / Guns / Driving / Languages -->
Shiki speaks 5 languages fluently and uses them to collect intel.

Despite disliking guns, Shiki has exceptional accuracy and speed with a pistol. They can hit you with a hip shot. They are also proficient with a sniper. They prefer close-quarter combat as it makes them feel more alive with the adrenaline, but they will use guns when necessary.

They are nimble and use a combination of Aikido and knives in CQC. Their signature move is grappling the opponent, making it impossible to shake them off, then slitting the opponent’s throat.

They get impossibly fast entering frenzy (or berserk mode), and seem to know no pain. Shiki can be pulled out of frenzy with something that resets their senses, but the cost is a head splitting hangover migraine for the next couple days.

## Strengths
Shiki is very sensitive to climate changes. They can tell you the humidity percentage and the temperature wherever they are. They would probably be really useful on ghost hunts if they weren't scared all the time...

Shiki is also very sensitive to sound; they will tilt and swivel their head like a dog or a cat if they hear something strange.
## Weaknesses
Conversely, Shiki gets very pathetic in a dry climate. In that sense, covering up serves two purposes, to minimize the amount of makeup they have to do and to avoid losing body moisture.

Shiki is weak to loud noises and bright lights. They are basically put out of commission if they're hit by a flash bang.

- Shiki shows very little skin below their neck, restricted to slivers of the wrist when they stretch. They wear sock garters so there are no forbidden ankles here.
- They're scarily good at puzzle games.
- They're weak to cute things (glances at boss). 
- Their room is split in half by a thick glass partition, where one side is a pool. This is where they sleep, and the sea otter lives there. The other half is all the operator and work tech, which are all extensively splash proofed.
# Social
## People They Admire
- Hard workers
- Masters of craft
## People They Dislike
- Lip service
- Manipulators
## Romantic History
<!-- Sexual History / Lovers / Thoughts towards Marriage / Romance -->
Not interested in romance or intimate relationships.
## Relationships
<!-- include behavior towards them -->
### Bimu
Bimu is Shiki's life saver and good friend. Shiki secretly admires Bimu for how passionate she is with everything. As her right hand, Shiki feels pressured to make sure Bimu is able to lean on them whenever she needs it. They also work in the background so Bimu has less things to worry about.
### Moe
Moe is Shiki's squad partner and rival. Shiki navigates for him or goes with him on missions sometimes. Moe brings out a younger, more competitive Shiki who believed there was good in the world. Their banter is friendlier.
### Timpani
They are business partners. Timpani is a good source of info and arms. Shiki sends little robots to retrieve pickup orders from Timpani's store. When the little guys are unavailable, though, Shiki will request delivery to various P.O. boxes in the city for later retrieval.

Occasionally, shit hits the fan and Shiki has to order in person. They feel uncomfortable under Timpani’s intense stare and smile, so they make small talk to dodge Timpani’s questions.

Later, Shiki commissions custom dampening earbuds from Timpani to protect themselves  from certain frequencies.
### Ren
Shiki collected the intel about the Yozora family, and everything about Ren unsettled them. However, after actually meeting them and seeing those dead eyes, Shiki feels a weird connection to them. Perhaps they recognize a fellow walking dead.
