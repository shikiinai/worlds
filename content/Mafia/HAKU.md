> [!bug] CW: vore. This person is also slightly NSFW / 18+.

> [!WARNING] Most of this information is secret.
> Very little is actually known about the elusive HAKU outside of their services. Some organizations theorize that HAKU is actually a group of people rather than an individual, given the wide range of services that they can provide. When HAKU's name comes up, it is often accompanied with the sentence, "be careful what you wish for."

## Employment / Education
\-
## Criminal Record
HAKU is wanted for many crimes, whether it is murder, extortion, assault and battery, scamming, etc. Arrests have been unproductive as they somehow slip out within the day. Clients are unwilling to give them up, as HAKU's services outweighs any grudges an individual may have.

## Awards / Achievements
Assassinations of multiple political figures, destruction of secret labs. HAKU has been employed as a bodyguard in high profile parties and negotiations as well.

## Medical Record
<!-- Surgeries, Cavities, Illnesses -->
\-
## Markings
<!-- Scars, Burns, Skin Damage, Birthmarks, Tattoos -->
\-
## Other Distinctive Characteristics
<!-- Nose & Eye Shape, Posture, Body Shape, Legs, Moles -->
HAKU enjoys changing appearances, but there are three constants: their hair color is light blue, their eye color is amber, and they have pointed ears. Occasionally they will completely change their appearance for two months, Just to keep others on their toes.
# Personality
<!-- Cheerful / Gloomy? 
Humorous / Violent? Active? Sociable? Intellectual? Virtuous? Expressive? Weakness / Worries / Unusual Traits. What is distinctive about them? -->
Cheerful, full of humor. Social butterfly who is friends with everyone, but whom no one is friends with. You can't help but tell them all of your secrets, but not even pillow talk will get you any of theirs.
## Formative Experiences
<!-- as an Infant / Young Child; include who was involved -->
Their real form is [Volgna-Gath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Great_Old_Ones), the Keeper of Secrets, a Great Old One from the Lovecraft Mythos. A slimy shape-shifting mass, which can be summoned with mud and the blood of the invoker. They ate their invoker, so no one knows where they came from.
## Dreams for the Future
A world that continues to fascinate them. A world that continues to have humans, who never cease to amaze them.

## Fears
No more humans :(

## Hobbies
<!-- Recreations, Clothing, Shelter, Habits, Favourite Phrases -->
People watching

## Special Skills
<!-- Fighting Styles / Sports / Dance / Martial Arts / Guns / Driving / Languages -->
HAKU will take a bullet for anyone. It doesn't hurt them. They laugh in the face of your confusion after you empty a clip into their body.

They fight with anything really. Shock factor is more important to them than actual damage, though they can and will suffocate you with only a napkin.

## Strengths
Highly adaptable to any situation

## Weaknesses
Dry climate makes them slower, both in speed and reaction, though not by much. It irritates them to no end and their fighting style gets more aggressive so they can leave faster.

> They eat a part of their client or target as payment. Don't worry, it's all very safe. It's about getting to know people better, learning the extent of their pain tolerance, and how they react to, well. Being eaten. The client is bound by magic contract, and forgets the experience after the contract is fulfilled. HAKU keeps their "dirty little secret" forever.

# Social
## People They Admire
Spontaneous people

## People They Dislike
Predictable people and robots

## Romantic History
<!-- Sexual History / Lovers / Thoughts towards Marriage / Romance -->
Many of HAKU's clients and targets end up in bed with them, as charismatic as they are. HAKU finds pillow talk useful, and is always delightfully surprised in the lengths humans would go to for intimacy. In a similar vein, romance is fun, but marriage is akin to the laws of man -- they exist to be bent, broken, and ridiculed.
