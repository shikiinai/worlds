## Inspirations
[[Shiki/index|You already know about shiki.]]

The underscore is pretty important. It's my middle name. I forget it a lot, especially when websites don't allow underscores in handles. Oops.

Turret is a direct reference to the [Portal turrets](https://theportalwiki.com/wiki/Turrets). I'd always really liked them, and I like to think I'm pretty good at imitating their lines. When I was designing a stream avatar, I thought it'd be funny if I had their antennae on my headphones.

## [[Logs]]
Files that shiki_turret found in their backup drive. They serve as in-universe records of real world events. I'm really behind on updating them... I promise I'll work on them...

## [[References#shiki_turret|References]]
There have been many designs over the years. While there is a story that ties them all together, all of them are valid. Being a robot, shiki_turret can switch parts and "revert" to a previous design. However, because of the persistent glitches on their skin surfacing, after a short while the parts will be corrupted and change to the most current design.
